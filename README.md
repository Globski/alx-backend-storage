## Environment
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- MySQL 5.7 (version 5.7.30)
- MySQL Workbench (optional for GUI)

## Requirements
- All your files will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using MySQL 5.7 (version 5.7.30)
- All your SQL queries should have a comment just before (i.e. syntax above)
- All your files should start by a comment describing the task
- All SQL keywords should be in uppercase (SELECT, WHEREâ€¦)
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- Comments for your SQL file:
```sql
$ cat my_script.sql
-- 3 first students in the Batch ID=3
-- because Batch 3 is the best!
SELECT id, name FROM students WHERE batch_id = 3 ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 3;
$
```

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- How to create tables with constraints
- How to optimize queries by adding indexes
- What is and how to implement stored procedures and functions in MySQL
- What is and how to implement views in MySQL
- What is and how to implement triggers in MySQL

## Prototypes Used in the Project

| Prototype Name                       | Description                                    |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| ComputeAverageWeightedScoreForUser   | Computes and stores the average weighted score for a student. |
| ComputeAverageWeightedScoreForUsers  | Computes and stores the average weighted score for all students. |

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/alx-backend-storage.git
   cd alx-backend-storage/0x00-MySQL_Advanced
   ```
2. **MySQL Server**: Make sure you have MySQL installed on your computer. You can download it from [MySQL's official website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).
3. **MySQL Client**: Use a MySQL client like MySQL Workbench or a terminal with MySQL command-line tools.

4. **Import the SQL Scripts:**
   Use the MySQL command line to execute the scripts, for example:
   ```bash
   mysql -uroot -p holberton < 0-init.sql
   ```

5. **Run Tests:**
   Each script can be tested sequentially to verify the results.

1. **Using Container-on-Demand:**
   - Request a container with Ubuntu 18.04 and Python 3.7.
   - Connect via SSH or WebTerminal.
   
2. **Start MySQL:**
   ```bash
   $ service mysql start
   ```

3. **Access MySQL:**
   ```bash
   $ mysql -uroot -p
   ```
   (Password is `root`)

4. **Import SQL Dump:**
   ```bash
   $ echo "CREATE DATABASE hbtn_0d_tvshows;" | mysql -uroot -p
   $ curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-higher-level_programming+/274/hbtn_0d_tvshows.sql" -s | mysql -uroot -p hbtn_0d_tvshows
   ```

- Each SQL script can be executed in a MySQL environment.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create databases and tables.
- If you encounter errors, make sure your SQL syntax is correct and that the necessary tables and procedures have been created successfully.

- Check that you're using the correct database by executing:
  ```sql
  USE your_database_name;
  ```

## Additional Notes

- **Creating Tables with Constraints**: Use primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints.
- **Optimizing Queries with Indexes**: Show how to create indexes for faster data retrieval.
- **Stored Procedures and Functions**: Demonstrate how to create and call procedures/functions.
- **Views**: Create views for simplified data access.
- **Triggers**: Set up triggers for actions like insert, update, and delete.

## Tasks

### 0. Initialize Database
Write a SQL script that creates and populates the table `names`.

### 1. Simple SELECT Queries
Write a SQL script that retrieves all the records from the `names` table.

### 2. Filtering Results
Write a SQL script that retrieves all the records from the `names` table where the score is greater than 50.

### 3. Aggregate Functions
Write a SQL script that retrieves the total number of names in the `names` table.

### 4. Grouping Data
Write a SQL script that retrieves the count of names grouped by their score.

### 5. Joining Tables
Write a SQL script that retrieves names and their corresponding scores from two different tables.

### 6. Subqueries
Write a SQL script that retrieves names that have a score higher than the average score.

### 7. Creating Views
Write a SQL script that creates a view that lists the names with scores above 80.

### 8. Triggers
Write a SQL script that creates a trigger to automatically update a field when certain conditions are met.

### 9. Indexing
Write a SQL script that creates an index `idx_name_first_score` on the table `names` and the first letter of name and the score.

### 10. User-Defined Functions
Write a SQL script that creates a function `SafeDiv` that divides (and returns) the first by the second number or returns 0 if the second number is equal to 0.

### 11. Views with Conditions
Write a SQL script that creates a view `need_meeting` that lists all students that have a score under 80 (strict) and no last_meeting or more than 1 month.

### 12. Stored Procedures for Weighted Scores
Write a SQL script that creates a stored procedure `ComputeAverageWeightedScoreForUser` that computes and store the average weighted score for a student.

### 13. Compute Average Weighted Scores for All Users
Write a SQL script that creates a stored procedure `ComputeAverageWeightedScoreForUsers` that computes and store the average weighted score for all students.
